# Time series forecasting using Spiking Neural Network
we use the MNIST dataset and follow the steps of creating a simple ANN, deploying it on a GPU, performing quantization using LoRA and QLoRA, and comparing the results.

Here's a structured plan to ensure we stay on track:

1.Load MNIST Dataset and Create ANN
2.Deploy ANN on GPU
3.Perform LoRA Quantization
4.Perform QLoRA Quantization
5.Compare Results
